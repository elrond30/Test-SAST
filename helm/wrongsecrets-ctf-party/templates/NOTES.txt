Wrongsecrets ctf party deployed! ðŸŽ‰ðŸ¥³

This doesn't come with a default way to expose it to the world.

To test it locally run:
$ kubectl port-forward service/wrongsecrets-balancer 3000:3000
You'll then be able to access the wrongsecrets-balancer in your browser under http://localhost:3000

To administrate the cluster you can log into the wrongsecrets-balancer with the admin account:
Username: admin
Password: ${kubectl get secrets wrongsecrets-balancer-secret -o=jsonpath='{.data.adminPassword}' | base64 --decode}
